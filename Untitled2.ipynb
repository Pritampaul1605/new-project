      "['Three Questions -  by Leo Tolstoy  \\n \\nOne day it occurred to a certain emperor that if he only knew the answers to three questions, he would never \\nstray in any matter.  What is the best time to do each thing? Who are the most important people to work with? \\nWhat is the most important thing to do at all times?  The emperor issued a decree throughout his kingdom \\nannouncing that whoever could answer the questions would receive a great reward. Many who read the decree made their way to the palace at once, each person with a different answer.  \\n In rep ly to the first question, one person advised that the emperor make up a thorough time schedule, \\nconsecrating every hour, day, month, and year for certain tasks and then follow the schedule to the letter. Only then could he hope to do every task at the right time.  Another person replied that it was impossible to \\nplan in advance and that the emperor should put all vain amusements aside and remain attentive to everything in order to know what to do at what time.  Someone else insisted that, by himself, the empe ror \\ncould never hope to have all the foresight and competence necessary to decide when to do each and every task and what he really needed was to set up a Council of the Wise and then to act according to their advice.   \\nSomeone else said that certain matters required immediate decision and could not wait for consultation, but if he wanted to know in advance what was going to happen he should consult magicians and soothsayers.  \\n \\nThe responses to the second question also lacked accord.  \\n \\nOne person said that the  emperor needed to place all his trust in administrators, another urged reliance on \\npriests and monks, while others recommended physicians. Still others put their faith in warriors.  \\n The third question drew a similar variety of answers. Some said science w as the most important pursuit. \\nOthers insisted on religion. Yet others claimed the most important thing was military skill.  \\n The emperor was not pleased with any of the answers, and no reward was given.  After several nights of \\nreflection, the emperor resolved to visit a hermit who lived up on the mountain and was said to be an enlightened man. The emperor wished to find the hermit to ask him the three questions, though he knew the hermit never left the mountains and was known to receive only the poor, refus ing to have anything to do with \\npersons of wealth or power. So the emperor disguised himself as a simple peasant and ordered his attendants to wait for him at the foot of the mountain while he climbed the slope alone to seek the hermit.  Reaching the \\nholy m an\\'s dwelling place, the emperor found the hermit digging a garden in front of his hut. When the hermit \\nsaw the stranger, he nodded his head in greeting and continued to dig. The labor was obviously hard on him. He was an old man, and each time he thrust his spade into the ground to turn the earth, he heaved heavily.  \\n The emperor approached him and said, \"I have come here to ask your help with three questions: When is the best time to do each thing? Who are the most important people to work with? What is the most important thing to do at all times?\"  The hermit listened attentively but only patted the emperor on the shoulder and \\ncontinued digging. The emperor said, \"You must be tired. Here, let me give you a hand with that.\" The hermit \\nthanked him, handed the  emperor the spade, and then sat down on the ground to rest.  \\n \\nAfter he had dug two rows, the emperor stopped and turned to the hermit and repeated his three questions. The hermit still did not answer, but instead stood up and pointed to the spade and said, \"Why don\\'t you rest \\nnow? I can take over again.\" But the emperor continued to dig. One hour passed, then two. Finally the sun began to set behind the mountain. The emperor put down the spade and said to the hermit, \"I came here to ask if you could answer my three questions. But if you can\\'t give me any answer, please let me know so that I \\ncan get on my way home.\"  \\n ', 'Three Questions -  by Leo Tolstoy  \\n \\nThe hermit lifted his head and asked the emperor, \"Do you hear someone running over there?\" The emperor \\nturned his head. They both saw a man with a long white beard emerge from the woods. He ran wildly, \\npressing his hands against a bloody wound in his stomach. The man ran toward the emperor before falling \\nunconscious to the ground, where he lay groaning. Opening the man\\'s clothing, the emperor and hermit saw \\nthat the man had received a deep gash. The emperor cleaned the wound thoroughly and then used his own shirt to bandage it, but the blood completely soaked it within minutes. He rinsed the shirt out and bandaged the wound a second time and conti nued to do so until the flow of blood had stopped.  \\n At last the wounded man regained consciousness and asked for a drink of water. The emperor ran down to the \\nstream and brought back a jug of fresh water. Meanwhile, the sun had disappeared and the night ai r had \\nbegun to turn cold. The hermit gave the emperor a hand in carrying the man into the hut where they laid him \\ndown on the hermit\\'s bed. The man closed his eyes and lay quietly. The emperor was worn out from the long day of climbing the mountain and dig ging the garden. Leaning against the doorway, he fell asleep. When he \\nrose, the sun had already risen over the mountain. For a moment he forgot where he was and what he had come here for. He looked over to the bed and saw the wounded man also looking around him in confusion. When he saw the emperor, he stared at him intently and then said in a faint whisper, \"Please forgive me.\"  \\n \"But what have you done that I should forgive you?\" the emperor asked.  \"You do not know me, your majesty, \\nbut I know you. I was y our sworn enemy, and I had vowed to take vengeance on you, for during the last war \\nyou killed my brother and seized my property. When I learned that you were coming alone to the mountain to meet the hermit, I resolved to surprise you on your way back to ki ll you. But after waiting a long time there \\nwas still no sign of you, and so I left my ambush in order to seek you out. But instead of finding you, I came across your attendants, who recognized me, giving me this wound. Luckily, I escaped and ran here. If I hadn\\'t \\nmet you I would surely be dead by now. I had intended to kill you, but instead you saved my life! I am \\nashamed and grateful beyond words. If I live, I vow to be your servant for the rest of my life, and I will bid my \\nchildren and grandchildren to do the same. Please grant me your forgiveness.\"  \\n The emperor was overjoyed to see that he was so easily reconciled with a former enemy. He not only forgave the man but promised to return all the man\\'s property and to send his own physician and servants to wait on the man until he was completely healed. After ordering his attendants to take the man home, the emperor \\nreturned to see the hermit. Before returning to the palace the emperor wanted to repeat his three questions \\none last time. He found the hermit s owing seeds in the earth they had dug the day before.  The hermit stood \\nup and looked at the emperor. \"But your questio ns have already been answered.\" \"How\\'s that?\" the emperor \\nasked, puzzled.  \\n \"Yesterday, if you had not taken pity on my age and given me a hand with digging these beds, you would have been attacked by that man on your way home. Then you would have deeply regretted not staying with me. Therefore the most important time was the time you were digging in the beds, the most important person was \\nmyself, and the most important pursuit was to help me. Later, when the wounded man ran up here, the most \\nimportant time was the time you spent dressing his wound, for if you had not cared for him he would have \\ndied and you would have lost the chance to be re conciled with him. Likewise, he was the most important \\nperson, and the most important pursuit was taking care of his wound. Remember that there is only one important time and is Now. The present moment is the only time over which we have dominion. The most  \\nimportant person is always the person with whom you are, who is right before you, for who knows if you will have dealings with any other person in the future. The most important pursuit is making that person, the one \\nstanding at you side, happy, for that alone is the pursuit of life.\"  \\n ']\n"

      "One day it occurred to a certain emperor that if he only knew the answers to three questions, he would never \n",
      "stray in any matter.  \n",
      " In rep ly to the first question, one person advised that the emperor make up a thorough time schedule, \n",
      "consecrating every hour, day, month, and year for certain tasks and then follow the schedule to the letter.  Another person replied that it was impossible to \n",
      "plan in advance and that the emperor should put all vain amusements aside and remain attentive to everything in order to know what to do at what time.  \n",
      " \n",
      "One person said that the  emperor needed to place all his trust in administrators, another urged reliance on \n",
      "priests and monks, while others recommended physicians.  After several nights of \n",
      "reflection, the emperor resolved to visit a hermit who lived up on the mountain and was said to be an enlightened man. The emperor wished to find the hermit to ask him the three questions, though he knew the hermit never left the mountains and was known to receive only the poor, refus ing to have anything to do with \n",
      "persons of wealth or power. So the emperor disguised himself as a simple peasant and ordered his attendants to wait for him at the foot of the mountain while he climbed the slope alone to seek the hermit.  Reaching the \n",
      "holy m an's dwelling place, the emperor found the hermit digging a garden in front of his hut.  \n",
      " The emperor approached him and said, \"I have come here to ask your help with three questions: When is the best time to do each thing? What is the most important thing to do at all times?\"  The hermit listened attentively but only patted the emperor on the shoulder and \n",
      "continued digging. Here, let me give you a hand with that.\" The hermit \n",
      "thanked him, handed the  emperor the spade, and then sat down on the ground to rest.  \n",
      " \n",
      "After he had dug two rows, the emperor stopped and turned to the hermit and repeated his three questions. The emperor put down the spade and said to the hermit, \"I came here to ask if you could answer my three questions. But if you can't give me any answer, please let me know so that I \n",
      "can get on my way home.\"  \n",
      "  Three Questions -  by Leo Tolstoy  \n",
      " \n",
      "The hermit lifted his head and asked the emperor, \"Do you hear someone running over there?\" The emperor \n",
      "turned his head. Opening the man's clothing, the emperor and hermit saw \n",
      "that the man had received a deep gash. The hermit gave the emperor a hand in carrying the man into the hut where they laid him \n",
      "down on the hermit's bed. The emperor was worn out from the long day of climbing the mountain and dig ging the garden. When he saw the emperor, he stared at him intently and then said in a faint whisper, \"Please forgive me.\"  \n",
      " \"But what have you done that I should forgive you?\" the emperor asked. After ordering his attendants to take the man home, the emperor \n",
      "returned to see the hermit. Before returning to the palace the emperor wanted to repeat his three questions \n",
      "one last time.  The hermit stood \n",
      "up and looked at the emperor. Therefore the most important time was the time you were digging in the beds, the most important person was \n",
      "myself, and the most important pursuit was to help me. Later, when the wounded man ran up here, the most \n",
      "important time was the time you spent dressing his wound, for if you had not cared for him he would have \n",
      "died and you would have lost the chance to be re conciled with him. Likewise, he was the most important \n",
      "person, and the most important pursuit was taking care of his wound.\n"
